CVFaceCenter
============

This program uses OpenCV to center faces in a series of images and then create a video. This tool will be used to help a friend who has taken a picture of himself every day for the past few years and wants the images to line up to make a cool video.

First run faceCenter.py to output the resized images (change the input and output paths). Next, run faceCenterVideo.py to turn the resized images into a video (edit the input and output paths and the fps).
